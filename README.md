As part of my Biomedical Engineering thesis, the aim of this project was to create a software that detects astrocytoma (a type of brain cancer) in histopathological images obtained through a microscope. Through a multi level process of image segmentation and process, feature extraction, training through exhaustive search (Leave-One-Out) and with the combination of 3 different classifiers (kNN, Bayesian and a Probabilistic Neural Network) for majority voting, the results that came out had quite good accuracy.
